# Real-Time Order Updates

> React to authenticated order and trade activity as it happens.

Use real-time order updates to keep your view of a trading account current
without polling. The user stream reports changes to the account's orders and
the trades created when those orders match. For public order-book and market updates, see [Real-Time
Data](/market-data/realtime-data).

<Note>
  Before subscribing, authenticate the account whose activity you want to
  monitor. See [Wallets and Authentication](/trading/wallets-auth).
</Note>

## User Stream

The user stream delivers order changes and trade updates for the authenticated
account. Subscribe without a market filter to follow the entire account, or
provide condition IDs to follow selected markets.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="TypeScript">
    Given a `SecureClient`, subscribe to the `user` topic:

    ```ts theme={null}
    const stream = await client.subscribe([{ topic: "user" }]);

    for await (const event of stream) {
      switch (event.type) {
        case "order":
          // event: UserOrderEvent
          break;
        case "trade":
          // event: UserTradeEvent
          break;
      }
    }

    <Note>
      The user WebSocket uses an application-level heartbeat. Send the text frame
      `PING` every 10 seconds; the server replies with `PONG`.
    </Note>

    Once connected, send a `user` subscription frame with the CLOB API
    credentials created through [API
    Authentication](/getting-started/api#authentication):

    ```json theme={null}
    {
      "auth": {

    ```

    <Warning>
      Send the subscription frame immediately after connecting. The server may close
      a connection that remains unsubscribed.
    </Warning>

    <Warning>
      Keep CLOB API credentials in a server environment. Never expose them in
      client-side code.
    </Warning>

    On the wire, `event_type` distinguishes order and trade events. For an
    order event, `type` identifies whether the order was placed, updated, or
    canceled.

## Understand Order Updates

Order updates tell you why the account's open-order state changed:

| Update | Meaning |
| - | - |
| Placement | A new order was accepted. |
| Update | Some or all of the order matched. |
| Cancellation | The remaining open amount was canceled. |

## Understand Trade Updates

Trade updates follow a match through onchain settlement. Confirmation and
permanent failure are terminal; a trade being retried may later be mined and
confirmed.

| State | Terminal | Meaning |
| - | - | - |
| Matched, not broadcast | No | The orders matched before an onchain transaction was broadcast. |
| Matched | No | The orders matched and the transaction was submitted for execution. |
| Mined | No | The transaction was observed onchain but has not reached finality. |
| Confirmed | Yes | The trade reached finality successfully. |
| Retrying | No | Settlement failed temporarily and is being retried. |
| Failed | Yes | Settlement failed permanently. |

## Recover After Reconnecting

Real-time updates do not replace authoritative account reads or replay every
change missed during a disconnection. After reconnecting, fetch the account's
open orders and recent trades from [Manage Orders](/trading/manage-orders), then
resume applying new stream events from that refreshed state.
