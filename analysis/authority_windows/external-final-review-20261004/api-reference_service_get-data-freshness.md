# Get data freshness

> How fresh the data behind this API is.

`/readyz` answers whether this pod can reach its datastore; this answers how
far behind chain head what you are reading is. Two halves, because each is
blind exactly where the other sees:

* `serving`; the projections that turn ingested rows into what the feeds
  read (`activity_feed` enrichment, `custody_balances` ingestion, the PnL
  engine).
  Each carries its own clock, so this is the only half that can see
  "everything stopped". `lag_seconds` is the worst age across them and
  `worst` names which one, so a single stalled projection cannot hide behind
  two healthy ones.
* `ingestion`; one crawl cursor per `(contract, event)`, summarised as the
  tail, the furthest-behind block, and the worst few cursors BY NAME. Every
  reading here is relative or positional, so under a total stall it reads
  green; that is why `serving` exists alongside it.

Streams that are dormant by design are dropped from `ingestion` rather than
reported, because they sit arbitrarily far back forever and would otherwise
fill the list and push the stream you care about off it.

Takes no parameters and is not paginated. Served from a snapshot refreshed
in the background, never computed on the request: `computed_at` and
`age_seconds` say how old it is, so a stalled refresher or a datastore
outage shows up as a growing age rather than a 500. Before the first refresh
lands there is nothing to serve and this answers `503`; "not measured yet"
and "measured, no lag" are different claims.

    The Polymarket Data API: wallet portfolios, trade and activity feeds, market
    state and ranked boards.


    ## Conventions every endpoint shares


    - **Envelope**: every response wraps its payload in `data` (paged routes add
    `pagination`). A documented miss is `data: null` or an empty list, never an
    error.

    - **Pagination is cursor-only**: follow `pagination.next_cursor` until
    `null`; `has_more` is exact, and there is no `offset` query parameter
    (sending one is a `400`). Cursors are signed, typed per endpoint, and
    opaque. The feeds (`trades`, `activity`, combo activity) are keyset walks,
    stable across concurrent writes; the boards, `holders` and most
    combo-position sorts are offset walks behind the opaque token, so a page
    taken across a data refresh can skip or repeat rows. Where a cursor binds
    its cohort (the boards, positions, combo positions), resuming bare is fine,
    restating the same values is fine, and contradicting them is a `400`. The
    `trades`/`activity` feed cursors carry only the seek anchor and page size
    (plus the sort direction on activity): re-send identical filters on every
    page, because changing one mid-walk re-anchors silently.

    - **Rate limiting**: `429` with `Retry-After` is the busy signal for heavy
    queries. A heavy query may first be queued briefly for a capacity slot; the
    `429` arrives only if that short wait ends unserved. Each caller also has a
    per-client request allowance, and bursts past it get the same `429` with
    `Retry-After` sized to the remaining wait. Retry after the given delay. A
    request that could not get a database connection within its budget is NOT a
    `429`: it is a `503` `request_timeout` with `Retry-After`, because the
    shortage is on the server side, not in the caller's rate.

    - **Identifiers**: `condition` (aliases `condition_id`, `conditionId`) is
    the unified query key for on-chain 0x condition ids; `market_id` fields
    carry Gamma's own market ids; `event_id` takes Gamma event ids; `token_id`
    is the CLOB asset id (the key on `/v2/prices-history`).

    - **Params** accept both snake_case and camelCase spellings.

    - **Units**: bare `volume`/`size` values are **shares**; `_usdc` suffixed
    fields are USD; `taker_` prefixed volumes are one-side.

    - **Sentinels**: `outcome_index: 999` means the outcome could not be
    labeled; a missing or `null` numeric field means unavailable, never zero.

    - **Windows on `/v2/trades?user=` and `/v2/activity`**: an omitted or `0`
    `start` floors to three years back (`start=1` asks for full history); an
    omitted or `0` `end` is now plus one day. The other `/v2/trades` shapes
    ignore `start`/`end`: `condition`/`event_id` serve a fixed three-year window
    and the bare feed serves the rolling current-plus-previous month. Other
    windowed routes treat omitted/`0` bounds as unbounded; each documents its
    own rule. `/v2/prices-history` is the strict one, where a `0` bound is a
    `400`.

    - **Errors**: every unsuccessful response is JSON with a human-readable
    `error`, stable `code`, `retryable` flag, and opaque `trace_id`; validation
    failures may also name `parameter`. Codes map to statuses as follows:
    `invalid_request` = `400`, `not_found` = `404`, `method_not_allowed` =
    `405`, `rate_limited` = `429`, `internal` = `500`, and both
    `request_timeout` (the request deadline, the datastore's statement timeout,
    or the connection pool's acquire budget) and `dependency_unavailable` =
    `503`. A `429` or `503` that is worth retrying carries `Retry-After` in
    seconds. Every response, successful or not, echoes the same id in the
    `x-trace-id` header; supply it when reporting a failure so operators can
    correlate it with telemetry.

    - **Auth**: none. All data routes are public; no API key or token is
    required.

        how

        far behind chain head what you are reading is. Two halves, because each

          Each carries its own clock, so this is the only half that can see
          "everything stopped". `lag_seconds` is the worst age across them and
          `worst` names which one, so a single stalled projection cannot hide behind
          two healthy ones.
        * `ingestion`; one crawl cursor per `(contract, event)`, summarised as

        Every figure here is over the LIVE streams only. Streams that are
        dormant by

        design sit arbitrarily far behind forever; they are dropped outright
        rather

        than reported and flagged, because there is nothing a consumer could do
        with

        them and including them is precisely what makes the list useless.
